# Advanced Java Practice Code

This repository contains all the code examples and projects I developed while learning from the **"Mastering Advanced Java with Object-Oriented Programming
"** course. The course focuses on mastering advanced Java programming concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Dependency Injection (DI), and Package Management.

# Overview
The course offers in-depth knowledge and practical experience in:
- Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- Dependency Injection as a design pattern for maintainable code
- Effective package management for modular applications
- Java design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer
- Secure coding techniques and access modifiers
- Real-world Java application development

# Key Learnings
OOP Principles: Implemented polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation effectively.
DI Implementation: Used Dependency Injection for loosely coupled and testable systems.
Java Design Patterns: Applied Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns in real-world scenarios.
Modular Code: Created and organized Java packages for maintainability.
Secure Coding: Used access modifiers and best practices to write secure Java code.
